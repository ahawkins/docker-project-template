{"name":"Docker Project Template","tagline":"Making it easy to build Docker based projects","body":"### Docker Project Template\r\n\r\nThis project is a template containing everything needed to bootstrap\r\ndocker based projects. It uses Make, Fig, & Vagrant to a completed\r\nautomated development environment out of the box. You can started by\r\nsimply downloading the files and unzip. This process is documented\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir my-new-project\r\n$ curl -L https://github.com/ahawkins/docker-project-template/tarball/master > template.tar.gz\r\n$ tar zxf template.tar.gz --strip-components=1 && rm template.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can bootstrap the development environment:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ vagrant up --provision\r\n$ vagrant ssh\r\n$ cd /vagrant\r\n$ make environment test\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease see the `README` on github for more information.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThis repo contains template files. Once you've downloaded the files\r\nupdate the to suit your project. The `Makefile` is a well documented\r\nbase to grow on. The template is provided without license, my only\r\nrequest is that you keep comments at the top of the `Makefile` and the\r\n`doc/RATIONAL.md` file in your repository.\r\n\r\n### Next Steps\r\n\r\nThis template gives you everything you need to start doing docker\r\nbased development. Unfortunately it cannot help you with more than\r\nthat. Checkout http://dockerbuild.info more information on building\r\nand shipping docker images.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nThis project is maintained by @ahawkins.
